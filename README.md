## 🤔 The Problem Every Developer Faces

```bash
# You know this pain...
$ docker logs my-app | tail -100
2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z [INFO] Processing request id=req_001234
2024-01-15T10:30:45.124Z [DEBUG] Database connection pool: 45/50 active
2024-01-15T10:30:45.125Z [WARN] Rate limit approaching for user_12345
2024-01-15T10:30:45.126Z [ERROR] Payment validation failed: invalid_card_number
2024-01-15T10:30:45.127Z [INFO] Retrying payment with backup processor
... 2,847 more lines of logs ...
2024-01-15T10:32:12.891Z [FATAL] OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

**What actually happened?** 🤷‍♂️ Good luck finding the needle in this haystack.

## 💡 The Solution: AI-Powered Log Intelligence

Docker Log Summariser MCP watches your logs and automatically creates **intelligent summaries** every 30 seconds:

```
🧠 AI Summary (Container: payment-service, 10:30-10:32)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 TL;DR: Payment processing degraded, then crashed with OOM error

🔍 Key Events:
• Rate limiting triggered for user_12345 
• Payment validation failed (invalid card)
• Automatic retry attempted with backup processor
• Memory exhaustion led to fatal crash at 10:32:12

❗ Anomalies Detected:
• Sudden spike in heap usage (normal: 2GB → fatal: 8GB+)
• Payment failure rate increased 340% in 2-minute window

❓ Questions for Investigation:
• Why did heap usage spike so dramatically?
• Is the backup processor handling retries correctly?
• Should we implement circuit breaker for card validation?

💰 Cost: $0.003 | 🏷️ Tokens: 1,247
```

**Now you know exactly what happened in 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes.** ⚡

# Deep dive into the critical incident
$ dlm show 23
🔍 Chunk #23 (payment-service, 14:30:00 - 14:30:30)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 TL;DR: Database connection pool exhausted, payments failing

🔍 Key Events:
• 847 payment requests received
• Database connection timeout after 30s
• Connection pool hit maximum limit (50/50)
• Circuit breaker opened, failing fast

❓ Investigation Questions:
• Is the database under unusual load?
• Should we increase the connection pool size?
• Are there long-running queries blocking connections?

# Ask targeted follow-up questions
$ dlm ask "What queries were running when this happened?" --chunk 23
🤖 Based on the logs, there were several long-running analytics queries that
   started around 14:25:00. These appear to be blocking the connection pool.
   Consider running heavy analytics on a read replica...
```

### 📱 Mobile App Error Investigation
```bash
# Analyse app logs from your CI/CD pipeline
$ npm start -- --url https://ci.company.com/builds/1234/logs.gz

# After processing, ask about specific errors
$ dlm ask "Why are iOS users experiencing crashes?"
🤖 The crashes are occurring in the image processing module when users
   upload photos larger than 5MB. The app runs out of memory during
   the resize operation. Consider implementing streaming resize...
```

### 🌐 Web Server Performance Analysis
```bash
# Monitor nginx access logs in real-time
$ npm start -- --file /var/log/nginx/access.log --follow

# Later, investigate performance issues
$ dlm ask "What's causing slow response times today?"
🤖 Analysis shows 3 patterns causing delays:
   1. Large file downloads (>100MB) blocking worker processes
   2. Increased bot traffic from 2 IP ranges
   3. Database queries taking 2-5x longer than baseline...
```

## 🆕 July 2025 Enhancements

### Range-Resume & File Rotation
The collector is now **fault-tolerant by default**:

* `--follow` survives log rotation (true *tail -F* semantics)
* HTTP / HTTPS downloads automatically resume using `Range` headers if the connection drops – perfect for huge archives and flaky links

No extra flags needed – just use `--file /path --follow` or `--url https://…`.

### New Prometheus Metrics
| Metric | Description | Labels |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| `bytes_ingested_total` | Total bytes ingested from all sources | `source_type` (`docker`, `file`, `url`) |
| `chunks_total` | Total log chunks emitted | `source_type` |

These are available at `/metrics` alongside the existing counters and histograms.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep bytes_ingested_total
```

### Updated CLI Help
`npx docker-log-summariser --help` now documents the auto-resume behaviour; there are no new flags, just smarter defaults.
